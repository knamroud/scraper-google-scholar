# scraper-google-scholar
This is a simple Jupyter Notebook containing a web scraper for [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)  
This requires a tor client installed on the running machine, and 10 doors. An example torc file is included in the repository.  
This program does nothing but return a list of bibtex entries. Wrote it on an internship.
